A set of links, etc for resources for learning Python

This repo exists simply to be a place for me to keep track of handy links, etc to good tutorials, etc, etc for learnign Python. Maybe this will become a more organized, useful resource some day -- but for now, jsut a place to park stuff so I can find it again.
